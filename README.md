# DoubleTaptoSleep

An Xposed module that turns off the display when you double-tap on the status
bar or lockscreen. Unlike most other modules that do this, this one is
standalone and does nothing else.

This implementation is mostly based on the one from [siavash79's AOSPMods](
https://github.com/siavash79/AOSPMods),
with some additional inspiration from the implementation in [LineageOS](
https://github.com/LineageOS/android_frameworks_base).
